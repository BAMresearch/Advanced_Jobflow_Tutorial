# Advanced Tutorial for Automating Tasks in Computational Materials Science with Jobflow

This tutorial is aimed at developers who would like to develop workflows with Jobflow. This could include contributions to [atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2) and [quacc](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/quacc).

This tutorial includes information on how to write a job for jobflows, how to connect jobs to a workflow including dynamic features and how to store job results in databases.
