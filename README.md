# Tutorial Automation

This is a first draft for a tutorial on automating computational chemistry tasks with jobflow. This tutorial is intended to brigde the gap between the current tutorials in jobflow, which explain how jobflow can be used for automatizing any task, and a advanced computational chemistry workflow manager as atomate2 which relieson jobflow.

Feedback is very welcome! I would like to publish the tutorial at some point but not now!
